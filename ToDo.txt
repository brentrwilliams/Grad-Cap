To Do:
- Test the Arduino being powered by the Portable USB Charger and communicating with the RPi
- Write a python program to interpret the serial input from the Arduino
- Clean up the Arduino code to only output the expected serial output
- Test Adafruit app sending text to Arduino that serially communicates with RPi to draw text on LED screen
- Pick out some images to draw
- Write python code to draw those images
- Update app to send request to draw images
- Figure out how to put everything in/on grad cap
- Figure out how to run python program on startup of RPi
